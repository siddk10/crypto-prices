Deployed with netlify at:https://crypto-prices121.netlify.app/

Created this project to practice my ReactJS skills.
This project allows you to view prices of cryptocurrency from wazirx and binance in INR.

I fetched the cryptocurrency values from wazirx and binance public api using axios.
Used Firebase for email/password authentication. Used React-Router-Dom for navigation. 

The wazirx dropdown values were fetched from API, so it takes time to fetch the option in dropdown.
